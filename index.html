        What is a croissant you wonder?

    <p>
        Let us tell you all about it:
        <br>
        A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃]) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of
        the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants
        are named
        for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
        succession,
        then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture,
        similar to a puff pastry.
